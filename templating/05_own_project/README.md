This is a project using golang templating engine. The concept is that the user can chose between components to create his own website. There is also a config where the user can chose between colors etc.

The project is still WIP.

Tech stack:
- Golang (backend & templating engine)
- React & Typescript (frontend dashboard)

Running: `go build && 05_own_project.exe`
